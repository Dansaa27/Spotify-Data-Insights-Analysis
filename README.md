Spotify Data Insights Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes over 600,000 tracks from Spotify to uncover key trends in music popularity. Using SQL and Tableau, I explored how attributes like danceability, energy, and explicit content, along with artist follower counts and release timing, influence listener engagement.

Data Source
The project utilizes two datasets from Kaggle:

Artists Table: Contains details about Spotify artists, including follower counts and popularity.

Tracks Table: Includes track-level attributes such as danceability, energy, valence, explicitness, and release dates.

These datasets provided a robust foundation for the analysis, allowing for the creation of meaningful insights into music trends.

Key Insights

Identified the most popular track attributes, showing correlations between danceability, energy, and explicit content with higher popularity scores.
Analyzed release trends, highlighting peak engagement periods like Q3 (July–September).
Uncovered "hidden gem" artists with low follower counts but high track popularity, showcasing their potential for growth.
Explored optimal track lengths, with medium-duration tracks (3–4 minutes) driving the highest engagement.

Tools Used
SQL: Performed extensive data cleaning, aggregation, and trend analysis.
Tableau: Created interactive dashboards to visualize insights and trends effectively.
Dashboards
Popularity Trends by Attribute: Shows how track features (e.g., danceability, energy) correlate with popularity.
Release Timing Analysis: Highlights seasonal and annual trends in track popularity.
Hidden Gem Artists: Spotlights artists with low followers but high track popularity.

How to Use
SQL Queries: Explore the SQL_queries.sql file to see the queries used for data analysis.
Tableau Dashboards: View the Tableau dashboards included in the repository for interactive visualizations.
Kaggle Dataset: Download the datasets directly from Kaggle (Artists Dataset and Tracks Dataset) to replicate the analysis.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in uncovering music industry trends. Insights can help artists, producers, and industry professionals optimize their strategies for audience engagement.
